# Micronutrient Action Policy Support (MAPS) - Glossary of Terms
Glossary of terms used within the MAPS project and the Micronutrient Support Tool

Terms are stored in markdown files within the `/terms` directory

At a minimum each term must have a title and short description in the yaml front-matter.  Extended content can be included as markdown which can include images etc and are converted into an individual webpage. e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micronutrientsupport/glossary/master/terms/uon.md
